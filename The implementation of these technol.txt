The implementation of these technologies presents challenges, including data management, scalability, and power requirements. Future directions should focus on integrating these systems with other precision agriculture technologies and addressing existing challenges to improve efficiency and sustainability, as noted by Karunathilake et al. (2023) [4]. Future illness management could be more productive and economical with the use of these cutting-edge instruments combined with digital platforms and data analytics. All of these research show how plant disease detection technologies have advanced.
