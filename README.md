Automatic-File-Sorter-in-File-Explorer

This Python script automates the process of organizing files by sorting them into folders based on their file types. It uses the os and shutil libraries to scan a specified directory, identify file types (e.g., .csv, .png, .txt, .jpeg, .jpg, .xlsx), and automatically moves them into designated folders like "CSV files", "Image files", and "Text files". The script creates these folders if they don’t already exist, ensuring that your directory stays organized.

Features:
Supported File Types: .csv, .png, .txt, .jpeg, .jpg, .xlsx.
Automated Folder Creation: Creates necessary folders based on file types.
Efficient Organization: Moves files only if they don't already exist in the target folder
